# Subquery

![alt text](subquery.png "subquery")

when we need to write two query we should compin them down into one by subquery

SELECT name, price 
FROM products
WHERE price > (
SELECT MAX(price)
FROM products
WHERE department = 'Toys'  
);

if we need subquery in select in must return single value

SELECT name, price, (SELECT MAX(price) FROM products)
FROM products
WHERE privce > 876;


Another example:

SELECT name, price, (SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = 3;) AS id_3
FROM products
WHERE privce > 876;

SELECT name, price, price / (
SELECT MAX(price)
FROM phones
) AS price_ratio
FROM phones
