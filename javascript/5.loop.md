- use while loop when you don't know ho many times you will run code inside while 

- if you know how many time to loop use for loop

break  used to stop the loop

while(true){
    if(condition){
        break
    }
}

# for...of  used in arry characters

 const arrs =  [1,2,3]
for(let v of arrs){
    console.log(v);
}

# for...in used for objects

for(key in myMovies){
    console.log(` ${key} ${myMovies[key]}`);
}
